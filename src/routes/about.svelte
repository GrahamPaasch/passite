## Purpose
This is the passing siteswap assistant helping you to find, start and animate [passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_(juggling)) patterns. 

It's currently based around [siteswaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteswap). Hopefully it will support a much wider pattern variety one day.

Solo siteswaps are supported as well by changing the number of jugglers to one.

## Features
- Siteswap generator
- Start configuration calculator
- Causal Diagrams
- Web App that works offline
- Reusable js components
- 3d Animation

## Browser support
Should run in any modern desktop or mobile browser which supports WebGL.
